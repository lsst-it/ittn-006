Tucson Lab(s)

Tucson lab(s) should resemble Chile as much as possible in terms of network and deployment.

A Kubernetes cluster is deployed as a testing stand with the same deployment done in Chile. This allows users to test tools under similar conditions of what can be found in the clusters deployed at Chile.
