Summit Data Center

Summit Data Center is located in Cerro Pachon, Chile. The racks are designed with top-of-rack switching and network cables are adjusted and re-certified to the necessary length.
Access to the Data Center is monitored by a Rubin Observatory keyless access system. [need more information about ups, cooling, and physical features.]
