Base Data Center
----------------
The Rubin Observatory Base Datacenter is located in La Serena, Chile, in a shared location with other AURA programs. However, Rubin Observatory maintains full independence of administration and design of its cabinets. 
The logical design of the cabinets is based on top-of-rack switching, meaning that devices connect to a switch located at the top of each rack, facing to the back to facilitate its cabling. To avoid lengthy slacks of network cables, they will be adjusted to fit the required length. All network cables will be re-certified for cat6 after adjusting. 
The Datacenter has access control, several circuits to support redundant power supplies, [need more information about ups, cooling, and physical features.]
