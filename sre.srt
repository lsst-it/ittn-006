Site Reliability Engineering
============================
Rubin IT adopts the Site Reliability Engineering methodology of work.
Operations is approached as a software problem, engineers in the IT group use the following principles to operate:

- Service Level Objectives: Services are managed by objectives, which are defined by all the stakeholders of such service. IT engineers follow these SLOs and act when these are not met.
- Automation: Repetitive tasks are automated. There are still tasks that won't be possible to automate but the objective of the IT team is to automate as much as possible.
- Share ownership with developers: There are no rigid boundaries between IT engineers and software developers. IT is more focused in production problems rather than the logic of the software.

Details of the SRE implementation can be reviewed here [link to technote].
