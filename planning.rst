Planning
========

This technote serves as a roadmap for Rubin IT activities. Several projects will be initiated to accomplish what has been laid out in the technote.

The planning of the projects are being followed in two Jira projects:

- `IT Plan <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/projects/ITP/issues>`_:  Main Jira project to follow the progress of IT projects spawned from this technote. Primavera pulls updates from this project.
- `IT <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/projects/IT/issues>`_: This Jira project mixes Epics that are created from ITP and Epics from current operational issues.

Priorities of projects can be viewed here: https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/IT/IT+Chile+Priorities

These new projects imply an extra expense in the Rubin IT budget. Details of these expenses can be found in The Financial Forecast report.
