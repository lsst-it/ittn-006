Networking
----------
To accommodate the demanding requirements of the computing and storage deployments of Rubin Observatory, IT provides a highly available and scalable network design.
The network is logically separated in Campus and Control, both networks have a backplane of redundant 100GB links, and maintain the concept of TOR to connect devices.

For details of the Network design please review `Network Infrastructure High-Level Design <https://ittn-018.lsst.io/>`_

Wireless device are controlled from a central location and connected to an identity management system to authorize users and route them to their correct network segment.

For details of the Wireless infrastructure design please review `Wi-Fi Infrastructure High-Level Design <https://ittn-016.lsst.io/>`_

La Serena building has mostly Rubin Observatory Access Points, hence there is integration with NOIRLabs networks. Users can log in to the corresponding SSID of their program, authenticate against their backends, and use their gateways.
