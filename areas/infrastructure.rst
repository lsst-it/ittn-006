Infrastructure
--------------
IT infrastructure will be managed in a continuous delivery and continuous integration pipeline. Systems will be orchestrated from a central platform, allowing a rapidly scalable infrastructure and minimizing human errors by automating deployments. Rubin Observatory software will be integrated into this platform.

Production environment consists of virtual machines and containers running in physical clusters. Testing and development infrastructure has local resources but also leverages cloud computing resources.

For details about the deployment platform please review https://ittn-002.lsst.io/
