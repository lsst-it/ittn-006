Authentication and Authorization
--------------------------------
Rubin Observatory will maintain 2 types of accounts, organization accounts (typically email) and production environment accounts. The user will be the same but the system managing the accounts are separated.      
IT will provide 2FA and sudo escalation upon approval. The administration of the accounting will be done in a centralized platform, servers or services will register to this platform after deployment.                                                          
To streamline access to resources and to promote self-service, the granting of access will be delegated to a responsible or point of contact of such servers or services. IT will always be capable to provide access but the approval must always be done by the responsible of the server or service.
