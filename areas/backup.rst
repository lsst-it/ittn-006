Backup
------
IT provides data and disaster recovery services to the production environment of Rubin Observatory. The backup platform is capable to recover historical configuration data from up to 6 months. Scientific data is not included in this backup platform. 

Historical data is stored in virtual library tapes, there's also a smaller staging area to hold backups for a few days before they are sent to historical archiving. The staging area allows the quick recovery of files due to bugs, crashings of systems, or human errors.
