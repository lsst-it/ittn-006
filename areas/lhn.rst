Long Haul Network
-----------------
The LHN is a dedicated network to transport science data to the USDF. For details of it please review `Rubin Observatory Network Design <https://ls.st/lse-78>`_.

Rubin IT provides support to execute tests during the construction phase of the Observatory, and also collaborates with other members of the NET-LHN team to troubleshoot problems detected in the network path to the USDF.
