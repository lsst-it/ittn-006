Monitoring
----------

IT provides monitoring metrics for the network, servers, services, and environmental variables of the Rubin Observatory datacenters.
Metrics are collected by different sources such as app collectors and SNMP queries. The visualization of these metrics are managed by an open-source dashboard, which contains sub-dashboards with groups of servers. The access of the sub-dashboards is delegated to groups of users with common monitoring needs.
The monitoring platform is deployed in a reliable, maintainable, and repeatable platform, to guarantee its operation in a stable state.
The platform trigger notifications of outages and thresholds, that are managed by a central alerting system forwarding them to several Rubin's communication channels.

For details of the platform, please review https://ittn-007.lsst.io/
