Monitoring
----------

IT will provide monitoring metrics for the network, servers, services, and environmental variables of the Rubin Observatory datacenters. 
Metrics will be collected by different sources such as app collectors and SNMP queries. The visualization of these metrics will be managed by an open-source dashboard, which will contain sub-dashboards with groups of servers. The access of the sub-dashboards will be delegated to groups of users with common monitoring needs. 
The monitoring platform will be deployed in a reliable, maintainable, and repeatable platform, to guarantee its operation in a stable state. 
The platform will trigger notifications of outages and thresholds, that will be managed by a central alerting system forwarding to several Rubin's communication channels. 

For details of the platform, please review https://ittn-007.lsst.io/
